      <p>
        There is a dangerous stage in building software where a feature starts
        looking finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        The search box worked. Type something, get a few experiments, click
        one, move on.
      </p>

      <p>For a while, that was enough.</p>

      <p>Then VLabs grew.</p>

      <p>
        More semesters. More subjects. More experiments. And, more
        importantly, much more content inside every experiment.
      </p>

      <p>At some point we had to ask a slightly uncomfortable question:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          What does it actually mean for a student to search a virtual lab?
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        If they remember the name of an experiment, the old search works. But
        what if they remember a sentence from the theory? A procedure step? A
        concept they saw somewhere but don&rsquo;t remember which experiment
        it belonged to?
      </p>

      <p>That was the point where search stopped being a small UI problem.</p>

      <Callout $tone="tip">
        <strong>Where this ended up, for anyone skimming</strong>
        <p>
          Dropdown over <code>title</code>/<code>description</code> →
          full-text ⌘K command palette → index moved out of the browser and
          into the build step → a stray <code>findIndex()</code> fixed →
          hyphen-insensitive, order-independent word matching → a debounce to
          stop live 3D previews from fighting the user&rsquo;s typing. Same
          feature, five different kinds of problem.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* OLD SEARCH */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>The search we started with</h2>

      <p>This was the original search.</p>

      <BlogImage
        src="/blog/05-search-optimisation/old-search-box.png"
        alt="Original VLabs search interface showing a simple dropdown of matching experiments"
        caption="The original search — functional, but not particularly useful once you knew what you were looking for."
        wide
      />

      <p>It did one thing: match an experiment and show it in a dropdown.</p>

      <p>
        Type <strong>HALF</strong> and you get Half-Wave Rectifier, Half
        Adder, Half Subtractor, and a few other things that happen to contain
        the same word.
      </p>

      <p>Which sounds reasonable until you look at what the result tells you.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Not much.</strong>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>No theory snippet.</li>
        <li>No procedure step.</li>
        <li>No indication of where inside the experiment the match came from.</li>
        <li>No preview of the circuit.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Just a title, a subject, and a few tags.</p>

      <p>The search knew <em>what</em> an experiment was called.</p>

      <p>It didn&rsquo;t know anything about the experiment itself.</p>

      <p>And the implementation was almost as simple as the UI.</p>

      <p>
        The search worked against <code>ALL_EXPERIMENTS</code>, which carried
        basic metadata for each experiment — title, description, tags and
        circuit ID. Matching was essentially a collection of{" "}
        <code>includes()</code> checks across that array.
      </p>

      <p>That was perfectly reasonable when the question was:</p>

      <p>
        <em>&ldquo;Does this experiment look like the thing I&rsquo;m searching for?&rdquo;</em>
      </p>

      <p>We were starting to ask a different question:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>&ldquo;Where does this concept appear anywhere inside the lab?&rdquo;</strong>
      </p>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* REDESIGN */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>We wanted search to understand the labs</h2>

      <p>The next version wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be just a nicer input box.</p>

      <p>We wanted search to become a way of navigating the entire lab.</p>

      <p>
        The target was a proper <strong>⌘K command palette</strong> —
        something closer to the search experience you&rsquo;d expect from a
        documentation platform than a dropdown attached to a navbar.
      </p>

      <BlogImage
        src="/blog/05-search-optimisation/new-search-box-v1.jpeg"
        alt="First VLabs command palette implementation"
        caption="The first command-palette version — a much bigger search surface than the original dropdown."
        wide
      />

      <p>Suddenly the search had room to tell us more.</p>

      <p>
        A result could now show its semester, subject and experiment. It
        could point to the exact section where the match occurred and show a
        snippet of the content around it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also added experiment preview cards, semester filtering,
        highlighted matches, and a keyboard-first flow you could open with{" "}
        <code>⌘K</code>.
      </p>

      <p>But the UI was only the visible part of the change.</p>

      <p>The real requirement underneath it was much bigger:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Search shouldn&rsquo;t just find experiments. It should find things
          inside experiments.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>That meant search needed access to the actual lab content.</p>

      <p>
        Theory. Procedure steps. Descriptions. The text a student actually
        reads while doing an experiment.
      </p>

      <p>Which meant we needed to build an index.</p>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* FIRST INDEX */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>The first index worked a little too well</h2>

      <p>The first implementation was straightforward.</p>

      <p>
        We created a <code>SearchIndexEntry</code> shape, flattened the
        experiments and their content into a searchable array, and let the
        command palette search through it.
      </p>

      <p>It worked.</p>

      <p>And then we looked at what &ldquo;working&rdquo; actually meant.</p>

      <p>
        To build that index in the browser, the browser needed access to the
        actual lab content.
      </p>

      <p>Every semester. Every subject. Every experiment.</p>

      <p>
        Every theory paragraph and procedure step we wanted to make
        searchable — walked, parsed and flattened, in the user&rsquo;s
        browser, before a single character had even been typed.
      </p>

      <p>We had solved the search problem by creating a bundle problem.</p>

      <p>The search was better.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>The architecture wasn&rsquo;t.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the first real optimisation decision: the browser
        didn&rsquo;t need to know <em>how</em> the index was built.
      </p>

      <p>It only needed the finished index.</p>

      <p>
        We didn&rsquo;t land on that by staring at a flame graph. Shubham —
        VLabs&rsquo; founder, and the person every weird bug eventually
        reaches — said it first, in two messages at 3:34 and 3:39 in the
        morning:
      </p>

      <FounderNote from="Shubham" role="Founder, VLabs">
        <p>
          &ldquo;so, we&rsquo;re building this semantic search most of the
          TEXTS. but the search gets through too many file systems at once
          when fetching things. client can get exhausted.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;somebody must work towards optimizing these things. option
          is maybe to — dump all semantics in a single file — always let that
          ONE file be fetchable by the search and links inside that itself.
          rather than going inside of{" "}
          <code>./01-analog-electronics/02-zener-diode..</code>,{" "}
          <code>./01-analog-electronics/03-e..</code>,{" "}
          <code>./01-analog-electronics/04-....</code>&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;we can just <code>./search-build-output.ts</code> fetch a
          single file. something like this. not sure where should lie
          tho?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;and this should be a BUILD method. on run build, some build
          files → outputted → helps in semantic searches. in this way devs
          don&rsquo;t have to optimize for every change they do and
          it&rsquo;s already in the npm run build commands on deps +
          builds.&rdquo;
        </p>
      </FounderNote>

      <p>
        That&rsquo;s the entire architecture decision above, typed into a
        chat before any of us had opened an editor. Strip out the
        punctuation and it&rsquo;s exactly what shipped: one fetchable
        output file, generated on <code>npm run build</code>, so nobody has
        to remember to re-optimize search every time they add an experiment.
      </p>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* BUILD TIME */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>Build the index before the browser arrives</h2>

      <p>So we moved the expensive part out of the browser entirely.</p>

      <p>
        A Node script now runs during both the development and production
        build process. It imports the real <code>SEMESTER_CONTENTS</code>,
        walks through the lab content, and generates the searchable index
        ahead of time — before any user ever opens the page.
      </p>

      <Pipeline
        steps={[
          "SEMESTER_CONTENTS",
          "build-search-index.ts",
          "buildSearchIndex()",
          "SEARCH_INDEX",
          "browser",
        ]}
      />

      <p>
        The generated result lives in <code>search-index.output.ts</code>.
        The client doesn&rsquo;t import the individual lab content modules
        anymore — it gets a flat array that&rsquo;s already prepared for
        searching.
      </p>

      <p>The important part is what disappeared from the browser:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>No walking through semester folders.</li>
        <li>No loading every theory and procedure module just to construct an index.</li>
        <li>No flatten-and-group pass waiting for the user to open search.</li>
      </ul>

      <Callout $tone="tip">
        <strong>Build once. Search many times.</strong>
        <p>
          The expensive work of understanding the lab structure belongs in
          the build pipeline. The browser should receive the thing it
          actually needs: a searchable index, not the means to construct one.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* RUNTIME PERFORMANCE */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>Then localhost started feeling slow</h2>

      <p>
        Moving the index out of the client solved the bigger architectural
        problem.
      </p>

      <p>But the search still didn&rsquo;t feel perfect during development.</p>

      <p>
        The first thing we had to separate was development performance from
        production performance. <code>next dev</code> is not a production
        build — React development behaviour, unminified code, and missing
        production optimisations can make the same interaction feel very
        different from what ships.
      </p>

      <p>But there were also real problems in the code.</p>

      <p>One of them was particularly easy to miss.</p>

      <p>
        There was a <code>findIndex()</code> sitting inside the result
        rendering loop — called once per header row, and again per snippet
        row, on every single render.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>{`// before — re-scans the whole list for every row, every render
const idx = flatItems.findIndex((f) => f.entry.id === s.id);`}</code>
      </pre>

      <pre>
        <code>{`// after — built once per render, looked up in O(1) per row
const indexById = useMemo(() => {
  const m = new Map<string, number>();
  flatItems.forEach((f, i) => m.set(f.entry.id, i));
  return m;
}, [flatItems]);

const idx = indexById.get(s.id) ?? -1;`}</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        We weren&rsquo;t doing anything useful with those repeated scans. The
        lookup could be computed once and reused.
      </p>

      <p>
        A small change, but exactly the kind of work that disappears once you
        stop looking at the search algorithm and start looking at everything
        around it.
      </p>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* SEARCH QUALITY */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>Then search failed in a much simpler way</h2>

      <p>
        After all of that, we found a problem that had nothing to do with
        bundles, rendering, or WebGL.
      </p>

      <p>Search for:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>half wave</strong>
      </p>

      <p>And the search could fail to find:</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Half-Wave Rectifier</strong>
      </p>

          &ldquo;i kind of am curious about how the semantic search is being
          built on client.&rdquo;
        </p>
      </FounderNote>

      <p>
        Fair on all three counts — the regex pipeline genuinely could be
        improved, and the honest answer to &ldquo;how is it being built on
        client&rdquo; was, at that point, &ldquo;more than it should
        be.&rdquo; That question is what turned into the normalisation and
        token-matching work below.
      </p>

      <p>The computer was technically correct.</p>

      <p>The strings were different.</p>

      <p>Humans don&rsquo;t care.</p>

      <h2>Making search understand how people type</h2>

      <p>We stopped comparing the raw strings.</p>

      <p>
        The new normalisation step converts separators — hyphens,
        underscores, dots, and whitespace — into a flexible regular expression
        symbol that matches any gap.
      </p>

      <TransformDemo
        inputs={["Half-Wave", "half_wave", "half.wave", "half   wave"]}
        output="half[-_.\s]+wave"
      />

      <p>Now all those different spellings will successfully match against the same query.</p>

      <p>
        Because the regex allows any combination of these separators between words,
        punctuation doesn&rsquo;t get in the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Search starts behaving less like a strict string comparison and more like
        what a person expects when they type a query.
      </p>

      />

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* HIGHLIGHTING */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>Finding the match is only half the job</h2>

      <p>
        Once matching became token-based, the highlighting had to understand
        the same rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        Highlighting only the first occurrence wasn&rsquo;t enough anymore.
        If the query contained multiple words, every relevant token in the
        result snippet needed to be visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>buildHighlightRegex()</code> builds a pattern from the
        individual query tokens so a result can highlight each matched word,
        not just the one the old code happened to find first.
      </p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s a small detail, but it changes the experience quite a bit.</p>

      <p>
        The user shouldn&rsquo;t have to read an entire paragraph just to
        figure out why it appeared in the results.
      </p>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* THREE.JS */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>Then I put Three.js inside the search box</h2>

      <p>This is where things got slightly funny.</p>

      <p>
        The result cards looked better with circuit previews, so we added
        live <code>CircuitPreview</code> components.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which meant that typing into a search box could now change the
        result set, which could mount or unmount multiple WebGL canvases.
      </p>

      <p>A search result had somehow become a small rendering application.</p>

      <p>The previews looked great.</p>

      <p>They were also not something we wanted rebuilding on every character.</p>

      <p>
        We added a small debounce — about <strong>180ms</strong> — so
        matching, grouping, and preview generation wait until the user
        pauses typing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea isn&rsquo;t to make search feel slower. It&rsquo;s to avoid
        doing work the user is actively changing their mind about, before the
        result is even ready to be seen.
      </p>

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* FINAL STATE */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>What the search became</h2>

      <p>By this point, the search had changed in almost every layer.</p>

      <p>It started as a dropdown that searched experiment metadata.</p>

      <p>
        It became a command palette backed by a build-time index containing
        content from the actual labs.
      </p>

      <p>
        A student can open it with <code>⌘K</code>, type a phrase, filter by
        semester, and see exactly where the match came from.
      </p>

      <p>The result isn&rsquo;t just:</p>

      <p className="text-center">
        <Chip>Half-Wave Rectifier</Chip>
      </p>

      <p>It can tell you:</p>

      <ResultBreadcrumb
        parts={["Semester 1", "Analog Electronics", "Half-Wave Rectifier", "Theory"]}
      />

      <p>
        And underneath that path, it shows the actual piece of content where
        the match was found.
      </p>

      />

      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}
      {/* ENDING */}
      {/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */}

      <h2>The search box wasn&rsquo;t really the thing we were optimising</h2>

      <p>Looking back, the interesting part wasn&rsquo;t the ⌘K interface.</p>

      <p>That was the easy part.</p>

      <p>The harder problem was deciding where search should <em>live</em>.</p>

      <p>
        We started with a client-side substring check because there
        wasn&rsquo;t much to search. Then we wanted search to understand the
        actual lab content, which made the client-side approach expensive.
      </p>

      <p>So the index moved to build time.</p>

      <p>
        Then the UI exposed unnecessary rendering work. Then live circuit
        previews introduced WebGL into an interaction that needed to stay
        lightweight.
      </p>

      <p>
        And after all of that, a hyphen reminded us that good search
        isn&rsquo;t only about performance.
      </p>

      <p>It also has to understand what the person meant.</p>

      <p>
        A search box started as a small dropdown with an <code>includes()</code>{" "}
        call.
      </p>

      <p>
        It ended up touching the content architecture, the build pipeline,
        the browser bundle, the rendering lifecycle, input scheduling, and
        text normalisation of the entire platform.
      </p>

      <p>That&rsquo;s probably the slightly annoying thing about optimisation.</p>

      <p>You rarely optimise the thing you thought you were going to optimise.</p>

      <p>You start with a search box.</p>

      <p>Then you discover you&rsquo;re really optimising the system behind it.</p>
